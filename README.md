# Sideproject Management

_my ongoing attempt to get a grip on my sprawling mass of sideprojects_


## Guidelines

### Personal Notes

- every project should have a note of the same name in personal notes (Obsidian)
- this note should be fully auto-generated, ideally
- it should contain:
  - one or two descriptive sentences, which explain to future me what the repo is about
  - a screenshot or explanatory graphic
  - link to a question note (what does this project help with, why does it exist)
  - if relevant, links to related/preceding/successive projects

### README

- every project should have a `README.md`

- it should start with a heading `#`, either in line 1 or after a screenshot/video
- the README should hotlink a screenshot of the project
  - archived repos that are stumps or cannot be ran anymore can do without the screenshot


### Issues

- issues are to be tracked with GitHub issues, using the `gh` CLI tool in day-to-day
  - ideally, we'd like to have a backup layer for this
- `TODO.md` files are to be converted

## Thoughts/Lessons Learned

### Definition of Done

- DoDs are cool but have been proven kind of useless for me, because unless I do the things while working on the project actively, I'll simply never do them.

### Misc

- Project diversity: not all repos are to be treated the same. Some of my repos are tiny one-shot undertakings, and creating quality criteria for them with the same yard stick as for important, ongoing projects makes no sense
