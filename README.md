# Sideproject Management

_my ongoing attempt to get a grip on my sprawling mass of sideprojects_


## Guidelines

### Personal Notes

- every project should have a note of the same name in personal notes (Obsidian)
- this note should be fully auto-generated, ideally
- it should contain:
  - one or two descriptive sentences, which explain to future me what the repo is about
  - a screenshot or explanatory graphic
  - link to a question note (what does this project help with, why does it exist)
  - if relevant, links to related/preceding/successive projects
